Here, you can find a couple of my TidyTuesday participations for 2024. Even though, I believe R has easy to learn and beatiful dataviz capabilities, I am learning how to use Python to reach similar design quality. Learning from Joseph Barbier, Yan Holtz, and Cedric Scherer. 

1. Over the last twenty years, CO2 emissions from nation-states have surpassed those from state-owned entities and private companies. 
I revisited #TidyTuesday  week 21 – Carbon Majors Emissions. Includes key timeline dates to represent carbon emissions 1928-2022. 
Color palette: used separated colors from Grand Budapest Wes Anderson palette. Data: [Carbon Majors](https://carbonmajors.org/)

2. My first #TidyTuesday visualisation on Groundhog Day Predictions for week 4.  
I decided to show the substantial increases in prediction count after the famous movie « Groundhog Day » (1993). 
The city Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania was famous for its celebration of Groundhog days but it gained national attention over time.
